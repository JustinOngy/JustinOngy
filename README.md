## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

Explore my repositories to see a variety of projects, including some early creations like my 

🃏 [ Blackjack game](https://justinongy.github.io/Project-1-blackjack/), 🐦 [Twitter clone](https://twitter-clone-one-mauve.vercel.app/), and 🤖 [GPT-3 Landing page](https://gpt-3-6s9bujmi0-justinongy.vercel.app/) . These projects are public to showcase my journey from the beginning of my software development career. It was an incredible learning experience! 

My latest project I worked on was [Zoomify - A video calling app](https://github.com/JustinOngy/zoomify), using the latest technologies.

🎓 I've also included projects from my coding bootcamp at General Assembly Sydney, which I completed in November 2023.

🌐 Currently, I'm diving into 3D development with Three.js and Next 14/15—it's a fascinating field. 

🌍 I'm actively seeking fully remote software engineering roles or project opportunities worldwide. 

Feel free to connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/-justinong/) 💼, [Portfolio](https://www.justinong.au/) 🌐, or [Email](mailto:justin-ong@live.com.au) 📧.
